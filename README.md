Direct pay charity.

Watch the bits of green and gold flow.

Something to do with Heavens being escapism for the greedy.
Helps people imagine alternate ways of being charitable.
My wife an I had this idea, like when someone pays for your,
food in the drive-thru, what if Morpheus called resturants
and payed for someone's birthday party? We could even give 
credit to someone else. What if the sensation of being cared
for is what is really important, not so much the cost of a 
cheese burger.

## Use-cases
Hack CCTV to pick out old or broken cars? 
Uber donation interface? 
Distributed/mesh "buy someone a pizza"? 
Break-ups, evictions, mis-connections, people ask all over the place for help. Got to get there first to become essential.
The delivery-driver is in on it through Morpheus contacting delivery drivers through other means.
What if we wrote a system that self-regulated based on market accepted metrics,
but instead of 15% going to charity, 85% didn't go anywhere accept to being charitable.
It doesn't have to travel over seas to improve someone's day/life. 
"Goes to charity" are the problem words here.


How do we write "what goes around, comes around." into code?

ALSO, I'm stealing this trademark.
